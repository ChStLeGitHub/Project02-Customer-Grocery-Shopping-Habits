# Customer Grocery Shopping Habits
 
**Objective:** To analyze five datasets from the grocery delivery platform Instacart to provide stakeholders with insights into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.

**Accomplishments:** In no particular order, I discovered that the middle 50% of orders are placed between 10 am and 4:59 pm, the most common days for customers to go grocery shopping (by far) are Monday and Tuesday (with Thursday and Friday being the least common), 75% of customers place orders on a biweekly basis or more frequently, the majority of customers have placed 10 or fewer orders in total, and customers most commonly order only 1-10 products at a time. These insights have major implications for determining the optimal times to offer coupons and other incentives.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, data exploration, descriptive analysis, market basket analysis, and consumer insight generation
